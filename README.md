#Map of birth places for Marvel characters.

Data from the official Marvel wiki.

Originally done in a google map I did (https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zHVaAFkpSLUE.k19G-8uP-mdI&hl=en&gl=us&ptab=2&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&msa=0&z=2) and ported over to geojson via http://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/

Those with out a city I could find are indicated by a pin with a circle in it in this repo.

#Purpose
The reason for this map is to plot birthplaces of Marvel characters in way others could contribute to.
Thanks to the Marvel API each character (ok probably not everyone) now has a unique id.
This will allow all for contributions to be more easily added as well as allow other projects to pull data from this one.

#Contribute

Pulls welcome!!

Please request to add characters one pull or issue at a time so I can keep track.

For corrections please submit an issue and the correction.

This repo map doesn't spiderfy and with so many characters from "New York" this is needed.

Characters were mostly grabbed from this repo: https://github.com/asamiller/marvelousdb/tree/master/data/characters

There are also characters with no location. These are currently in the middle of the ocean a 0,0.
